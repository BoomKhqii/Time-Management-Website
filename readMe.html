			<h3>Problem</h3>
			<p>Lourdesians had always developed a problem from the moment they started school which is time management. Determined students explore new things in ways to manage time, something they cannot take back once lost. Those who struggle with time management are more likely to experience stress, sleep issues, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Most resort to cramming due to inefficient time management with continuous and consistent would ultimately result to a burnout.</p>
			<h3>Solution</h3>
			<p>I have noticed this problem and have experienced it myself. I have taken a short survey to students like me who has resolve the problem of time management, which I implemented in my website. My website includes To-do list and Pomodoro Technique which has involvement to increase motivation to users (Lourdersians). 
			<br>First major feature is the To-do list, users may add things to do or a reminder for the future. The contents of a list must have the following: type of work(pick among the selections), description (user preference of input), subject with selections, date, and time. The list uses PHP database to store contents of your list, moreover, the list can be deleted by the button that says "X". Additionally, whenever current date and time is the same as one of the list, it will make a alarm sound then alert the user with its description written. 
			<br>Second major feature I have is the pomodoro technique, you would pick the amount of hours you would like to accomplish and the amount of minutes you want to take a break. When study timer/break timer starts, both buttons are deactivated to avoid users repeatedly clicking on the button which causes to launch the function numerous times. Moverover, when the timer is done, both buttons are now enabled and it will make an alert sound and alert notification to notify users their study/break timer is done.Every completed session you increase the lifespan of the figure that is among the favourites of most students. This aims to motivate students to study and increase the lifespan of the character.</p>
			<h3>Planned features that wasn't implemented</h3>
			<p>- Make the character more interactive rather than simply "increasing" the lifespan of the said character</p>
			<p>- Failed to get matmat character</p>
			<p>- Calendar, you see you're to-do list among the dates and time assign</p>
			<p>- Better UI -> modern, LSM theme</p>
